abstract = {A highly sensitive and specific multiplex method for the simultaneous detection of three pathogenic bacteria was fabricated using multicolor upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as luminescence labels coupled with aptamers as the molecular recognition elements. Multicolor UCNPs were synthesized via doping with various rare-earth ions to obtain well-separated emission peaks. The aptamer sequences were selected using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) strategy for Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Salmonella typhimurium. When applied in this method, aptamers can be used for the specific recognition of the bacteria from complex mixtures, including those found in real food matrixes. Aptamers and multicolor UCNPs were employed to selectively capture and simultaneously quantify the three target bacteria on the basis of the independent peaks. Under optimal conditions, the correlation between the concentration of three bacteria and the luminescence signal was found to be linear from 50-106 cfu mL -1. Improved by the magnetic separation and concentration effect of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, the limits of detection of the developed method were found to be 25, 10, and 15 cfu mL-1 for S. aureus, V. parahemolyticus, and S. typhimurium, respectively. The capability of the bioassay in real food samples was also investigated, and the results were consistent with experimental results obtained from plate-counting methods. This proposed method for the detection of various pathogenic bacteria based on multicolor UCNPs has great potential in the application of food safety and multiplex nanosensors. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In this report, a dual-excitation sensing method was developed using aptamer-functionalized quantum dots and upconverting nanoparticles, exhibiting Stokes and anti-Stokes type excitation profiles, respectively. Conjugation of the aptamer-functionalized luminescent nanoparticles with the magnetic beads, comprising short DNA sequences that were partially complementary to the aptamer sequences, enabled facile separation of the analyte-free conjugates for fluorescent measurement. UV-Visible spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering and Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis techniques were used to characterize the aptamer probes developed. The target-specific luminescent conjugates were applied for multiplex detection of model food pathogens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus, in which the fluorescent emission spectra were obtained under UV excitation at 325 nm for quantum dots and NIR excitation at 980 nm for upconverting nanoparticles, respectively. The dual-excitation strategy was aimed to minimize cross-talk between the luminescent signals for multiplexed detection, and yielded limit of detection values of 16 and 28 cfu mL -1 for Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. By employing a greater number of quantum dots and upconverting nanoparticles with non-overlapping fluorescent emissions, the proposed methodology might be exploited further to detect several analytes, simultaneously.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of human's exploitation of nature and animal husbandry, zoonoses have become a major public health problem worldwide. It is necessary to establish a rapid, specific and sensitive detection method to screen several zoonotic pathogenic bacteria simultaneously. In this study, phage display technology was used to screen specific peptide of three common zoonotic pathogens, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and B. melitensis 16 M. Then, three peptide were obtained, named E2, L4 and B4, which can identify the three pathogens respectively. Three peptide modified with biotin were synthesized and were coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads (MBs) to form peptide-MBs, which enriched the above three pathogens from the samples. Three quantum dot (QD) probes were constructed by coupling three polyclonal antibodies to different fluorescent QD surfaces (QD540, QD580 and QD630). The simultaneous detection method based on peptide-MBs and QDs multicolor fluorescent labeling was established and could detect E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and B. melitensis 16 M simultaneously. The detection method took about 100 min with the detection limits of 103, 102 and 102 CFU/mL, respectively. The detection method could be also well utilized in real samples.},

abstract = {Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an infectious cancer occurring most commonly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients and in endemic regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where KS is among the top four most prevalent cancers. The cause of KS is the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called HHV-8), an oncogenic herpesvirus that while routinely diagnosed in developed nations, provides challenges to developing world medical providers and point-of-care detection. A major challenge in the diagnosis of KS is the existence of a number of other diseases with similar clinical presentation and histopathological features, requiring the detection of KSHV in a biopsy sample. In this work we develop an answer to this challenge by creating a multiplexed one-pot detection system for KSHV DNA and DNA from a frequently confounding disease, bacillary angiomatosis. Gold and silver nanoparticle aggregation reactions are tuned for each target and a multi-color change system is developed capable of detecting both targets down to levels between 1 nM and 2 nM. The system developed here could later be integrated with microfluidic sample processing to create a final device capable of solving the two major challenges in point-of-care KS detection. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Current applications of QDs are widespread, their use as fluorescence labels in bioassays being one of the most promising. These nanoparticles are usually conjugated to highly specific biomolecules like antibodies, oligonucleotides, enzymes or aptamers to improve assay selectivity. In this review, QD surface passivation, conjugation to biomolecules, and purification strategies are discussed with special emphasis to the development of QD-based immunoassays for the detection of low molecular weight compounds given the relevance of this sort of analytes in health, food safety, pharmaceutical, or environmental monitoring areas.

abstract = {Accurate onsite profiling of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) is of vital significance for ensuring food safety and estimating environmental pollution. Here, we propose a smartphone-based QD ratiometric fluorescence-sensing system to precisely report the level of FQs. As a proof of concept, we chose gatifloxacin (GFLX, a typical member of FQs) as the model for the analytical target, which could effectively trigger the fluorescence color variation of QDs from bright yellow-green (∼557 nm) to blue (∼448 nm) through the photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) process, thus yielding an evident ratiometric response. Based on this, the level of GFLX can be reported within a wide linear range from 0.85 nM to 3.6 $\mu$M. Moreover, this assay owns a high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.26 nM for GFLX and a quick sample-to-answer monitoring time of 5.0 min, manifesting that this platform could be fully qualified for onsite requirements. Interestingly, this portable device has successfully been applied for the onsite detection of GFLX in real food (i.e., milk and drinking water) and environmental (i.e., fish-farming water) samples with acceptable results. This developed platform offers a great promise for the point-of-care detection of FQ residues in practical application with the merits of being label-free, low-cost, and rapid, thus opening a new pathway for the onsite evaluation of food safety and environmental health.},

abstract = {A rapid and multiplexed immunosensor was developed based on a quantum dot (QD)-reverse assaying strategy (RAS) and immuno-magnetic beads (IMBs) for one-step and simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157: H7 and Salmonella. In a conventional QD-based immunosensor, the fluorescence signal of the “IMBs-target-QD” immunoconjugate is directly used as the assaying readout. However, the fluorescence signal is affected by IMBs due to light scattering and the “IMBs-target-QD” immunoconjugate needs multiple washing and re-suspension steps. To address these problems, we use the surplus QD-antibody conjugate as signal readout in the RAS, which prevents interference from the IMBs, increases the fluorescence signal, and avoids complex operations. Compared with conventional QD-based immunosensor, the sensitivity of QD-RSA immunosensor for detection of Escherichia coli O157: H7 has been improved fifty-fold, and whole analysis procedure can be finished within 1 h. Therefore, this RSA strategy is promising for improving the performance of QD-based immunosensors and could greatly broaden their applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a peptide-mediated immunomagnetic separation technique and an immunofluorescence quantum dot technique for simultaneous and rapid detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. First, three peptides that can specifically recognize the three foodborne pathogens were combined with magnetic nanoparticles to form an immunomagnetic nanoparticle probe for capturing three kinds of target bacteria and then added three quantum dot probes (quantum dots-aptamer), which formed a sandwich composite structure. When the three quantum dot probes specifically combined with the three pathogenic bacteria, the remaining fluorescent signal in the supernatant will be reduced by magnetic separation. Therefore, the remaining fluorescent signal in the supernatant can be measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer to indirectly determine the three pathogens in the sample. The linear range of the method was 10-107 cfu/mL, and in the buffer, the detection limits of E. coli O157:H7, S. aureus, and V. parahaemolyticus were 2.460, 5.407, and 3.770 cfu/mL, respectively. In the tap water simulation, the detection limits of E. coli O157:H7, S. aureus, and V. parahaemolyticus were 2.730, 1.990 × 101, and 4.480 cfu/mL, respectively. In the milk simulation sample, the detection limits of E. coli O157:H7, S. aureus, and V. parahaemolyticus were 6.660, 1.070 × 101, and 2.236 × 101 cfu/mL, respectively. The method we presented can detect three kinds of foodborne pathogens at the same time, and the entire experimental process did not exceed 4 h. It has high sensitivity and low detection limit and may be used in the sample detection of other pathogens.},

Detailed characterization is hampered, however, by limitations in available probes and instrumentation. Here, we use the unique spectral properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) to extend the capabilities of polychromatic flow cytometry to resolve 17 fluorescence emissions. We show the need for this power by analyzing, in detail, the phenotype of multiple antigen-specific T-cell populations, revealing variations within complex phenotypic patterns that would otherwise remain obscure. For example, T cells specific for distinct epitopes from one pathogen, and even those specific for the same epitope, can have markedly different phenotypes. The technology we describe, encompassing the detection of eight quantum dots in conjunction with conventional fluorophores, should expand the horizons of flow cytometry, as well as our ability to characterize the intricacies of both adaptive and innate cellular immune responses. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Consumption of foods contaminated with pathogenic bacteria is a major public health concern. Foods contain microorganisms, the overwhelming majority of which are nonpathogenic, some are responsible for food spoilage, and some cause serious illness leading to death or a variety of diseases in humans. The key challenge in food safety is to rapidly screen foods to determine the presence of pathogens so that appropriate intervention protocols can be pursued. A simple fluorometric immunological method in combination with a magnetic concentration step was developed for rapid detection of target bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity in less than 2. h without enumeration. The method constitutes performing an in-situ immunoassay on a magnetic bead through the formation of a sandwich complex of the target bacteria and the probe (detection antibody-denatured BSA labelled with fluorophores) followed by the release of fluorophores by means of enzymatic digestion with proteinase K. The limit of detection (LOD) was <5. CFU/mL of the tested pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes) in buffer. When the pathogens were inoculated in foods (spinach, chicken, and milk), the LOD was under 5. CFU/mL for E. coli O157:H7, S. typhimurium and L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, the method was highly specific in detecting the target pathogens in a multiplex format. The developed in-situ fluorescent immunomagnetic sensor approach offers distinct advantages because it is rapid, highly sensitive, and easy to use and could therefore be potentially used as a pathogen screening tool. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Using the water-in-oil reverse microemulsions method, the $\gamma$-Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticles were coated with silica to empower the particles with high dispersibility and broad compatibility to biomacromolecules. The magnetic beads were then modified with amino silane, which could immobilize antibodies by glutaraldehyde treatment. The immunized magnetic beads and pathogenic bacteria formed "bead-cell" complexes in the enrichment procedure. QDs with different emission wavelengths (620, 560, and 520 nm) were immobilized with anti-S. typhimurium antibody, anti-S. flexneri antibody, and anti-E. coliO157:H7 antibody, respectively. Fluorescence microscope images and the fluorescence intensity of QDs labeled "sandwich" complexes (conjungated with antibodies against S. typhimurium, S. flexneri, and E. coli O157:H7, respectively) demonstrated that antibody-conjugated QDs could attach to the surface of bacterial cells selectively and specifically. In our method, we could detect food-borne pathogen bacteria in a food matrix at 10-3 cfu/mL We determined that a high concentration of proteins in food matrix would decrease the sensitivity of this method.
