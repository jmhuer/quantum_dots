abstract = {We report a simple, affordable (∼0.02 US $/test), rapid (within 5 min), and quantitative paper-based sensor integrated with smartphone application for on-spot detection of hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration using approximately 10 \muL of finger-pricked blood. Quantitative analytical colorimetry is achieved via an Android-based application (Sens-Hb), integrating key operational steps of image acquisition, real-time analysis, and result dissemination. Further, feedback from the machine learning algorithm for adaptation of calibration data offers consistent dynamic improvement for precise predictions of the test results. Our study reveals a successful deployment of the extreme point-of-care test in rural settings where no infrastructural facilities for diagnostics are available. The Hgb test device is validated both in the controlled laboratory environment (n = 200) and on the field experiments (n = 142) executed in four different Indian villages. Validation results are well correlated with the pathological gold standard results (r = 0.9583) with high sensitivity and specificity for the healthy (n = 136) (>11 g/dL) (specificity: 97.2%), mildly anemic (n = 55) (<11 g/dL) (sensitivity: 87.5%, specificity: 100%), and severely anemic (n = 9) (<7 g/dL) (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 100%) samples. Results from field trials reveal that only below 5% cases of the results are interpreted erroneously by classifying mildly anemic patients as healthy ones. On-field deployment has unveiled the test kit to be extremely user friendly that can be handled by minimally trained frontline workers for catering the needs of the underserved communities.},

abstract = {The serum creatinine level is commonly recognized as a measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is defined as an indicator of overall renal health. A typical procedure in determining kidney performance is venipuncture to obtain serum creatinine in the blood, which requires a skilled technician to perform on a laboratory basis and multiple clinical steps to acquire a meaningful result. Recently, wearable sensors have undergone immense development, especially for noninvasive health monitoring without a need for a blood sample. This article addresses a fiber-based sensing device selective for tear creatinine, which was fabricated using a copper-containing benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) metal-organic framework (MOF) bound with graphene oxide-Cu(II) and hybridized with Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs). Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to study the binding energies of creatinine toward the ternary hybrid materials that irreversibly occurred at pendant copper ions attached with the BDC segments. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to probe the unique charge-transfer resistances of the derived sensing materials. The single-use modified sensor achieved 95.1% selectivity efficiency toward the determination of tear creatinine contents from 1.6 to 2400 $\mu$M of 10 repeated measurements in the presence of interfering species of dopamine, urea, and uric acid. The machine learning with the supervised training estimated 83.3% algorithm accuracy to distinguish among low, moderate, and high normal serum creatinine by evaluating tear creatinine. With only one step of collecting tears, this lab-on-eyeglasses with disposable hybrid textile electrodes selective for tear creatinine may be greatly beneficial for point-of-care (POC) kidney monitoring for vulnerable populations remotely, especially during pandemics.},

@article{Shiba2018,
abstract = {A sensing signal obtained by measuring an odor usually contains varied information that reflects an origin of the odor itself, while an effective approach is required to reasonably analyze informative data to derive the desired information. Herein, we demonstrate that quantitative odor analysis was achieved through systematic material design-based nanomechanical sensing combined with machine learning. A ternary mixture consisting of water, ethanol, and methanol was selected as a model system where a target molecule coexists with structurally similar species in a humidified condition. To predict the concentration of each species in the system via the data-driven approach, six types of nanoparticles functionalized with hydroxyl, aminopropyl, phenyl, and/or octadecyl groups were synthesized as a receptor coating of a nanomechanical sensor. Then, a machine learning model based on Gaussian process regression was trained with sensing data sets obtained from the samples with diverse concentrations. As a result, the octadecyl-modified nanoparticles enhanced prediction accuracy for water while the use of both octadecyl and aminopropyl groups was indicated to be a key for a better prediction accuracy for ethanol and methanol. As the prediction accuracy for ethanol and methanol was improved by introducing two additional nanoparticles with finely controlled octadecyl and aminopropyl amount, the feedback obtained by the present machine learning was effectively utilized to optimize material design for better performance. We demonstrate through this study that various information which was extracted from plenty of experimental data sets was successfully combined with our knowledge to produce wisdom for addressing a critical issue in gas phase sensing.},

abstract = {The variability of bioparticles remains a key barrier to realizing the competent potential of nanoscale detection into a digital diagnosis of an extraneous object that causes an infectious disease. Here, we report label-free virus identification based on machine-learning classification. Single virus particles were detected using nanopores, and resistive-pulse waveforms were analyzed multilaterally using artificial intelligence. In the discrimination, over 99% accuracy for five different virus species was demonstrated. This advance is accessed through the classification of virus-derived ionic current signal patterns reflecting their intrinsic physical properties in a high-dimensional feature space. Moreover, consideration of viral similarity based on the accuracies indicates the contributing factors in the recognitions. The present findings offer the prospect of a novel surveillance system applicable to detection of multiple viruses including new strains.},

abstract = {Rapid antibacterial susceptibility testing (RAST) methods are of significant importance in healthcare, as they can assist caregivers in timely administration of the correct treatments. Various RAST techniques have been reported for tracking bacterial phenotypes, including size, shape, motion, and redox state. However, they still require bulky and expensive instruments which hinder their application in resource-limited environmentsand/or utilize labeling reagents which can interfere with antibiotics and add to the total cost. Furthermore, the existing RAST methods do not address the potential gradual adaptation of bacteria to antibiotics, which can lead to a false diagnosis. In this work, we present a RAST approach by leveraging machine learning to analyze time-resolved dynamic laser speckle imaging (DLSI) results. DLSI captures the change in bacterial motion in response to antibiotic treatments. Our method accurately predicts the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin and gentamicin for a model strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli K-12) in 60 min, compared to 6 h using the currently FDA-approved phenotype-based RAST technique. In addition to ampicillin (a $\beta$-lactam) and gentamicin (an aminoglycoside), we studied the effect of ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) on E. coli K-12. The machine learning algorithm was trained and validated using the overnight results of a gold standard antibacterial susceptibility testing method enabling prediction of MIC with a similarly high accuracy yet substantially faster.},

abstract = {Fluorescent array-based sensing is an emerging differential sensing platform for sensitive detection of analytes in a complex environment without involving a conventional "lock and key" type-specific interaction. These sensing techniques mainly rely on different optical pattern generation from a sensor array and their pattern recognition to differentiate analytes. Currently emerging, compelling pattern-recognition method, Machine Learning (ML), enables a machine to "learn" a pattern by training without having the recognition method explicitly programmed into it. Thus, ML has an enormous potential to analyze these sensing data better than widely used statistical pattern-recognition methods. Here, an array-based sensor using easy-to-synthesize carbon dots with varied surface functionality is reported, which can differentiate between eight different proteins at 100 nM concentration. The utility of using machine learning algorithms in pattern recognition of fluorescence signals from the array has also been demonstrated. In analyzing the array-based sensing data, Machine Learning algorithms like "Gradient-Boosted Trees" have achieved a 100% prediction efficiency compared to inferior-performing classical statistical method "Linear Discriminant Analysis".},

A potential solution is the additional integration of prior knowledge into the training process which leads to the notion of informed machine learning. In this paper, we present a structured overview of various approaches in this field. We provide a definition and propose a concept for informed machine learning which illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional machine learning. We introduce a taxonomy that serves as a classification framework for informed machine learning approaches. It considers the source of knowledge, its representation, and its integration into the machine learning pipeline. Based on this taxonomy, we survey related research and describe how different knowledge representations such as algebraic equations, logic rules, or simulation results can be used in learning systems. This evaluation of numerous papers on the basis of our taxonomy uncovers key methods in the field of informed machine learning.},
